# Throw_Dice
Throwing Dice 10 times and system generates(throws) dice 10 times. i will get point every time i guess the number


this exercise is done using javascript

i will explain you  how it works:

first of all i am using [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise?retiredLocale=it) to do this exercise.

i generate a number - then system generates a random number, <br>
i confront my number with system number only if my number is a integer and is between 1 and 6, <br>
if my number is equal is to system number i get 1 point; if not i get nothing(points remains 0), <br>
if i insert number greater than 7 and lower than 1 it  generated alert ___ insert number between 1 and 6 with printing wrong number in html or console, <br>
if i insert a string it gives alert ___ you inserted string instead of number and don't print that number in html or console. <br>
so i throw dice 10 times to finish te game or option => i can reset game at any time. <br>

i print list of my numbers and system numbers in html  <br>
game starts while clicking on button.
